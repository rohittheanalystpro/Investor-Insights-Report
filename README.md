# Investor-Insights-Report
Excited to share the findings of our behavioral finance project, where we delved into the psychology and behavior behind investment decisions. Using insights from 72 participants, we created a dynamic Power BI dashboard based on primary research data.

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀:
𝟭) Reaching a reliable sample was tough, as only ~10% of India's population invests. We broadened our scope to include hypothetical behaviors for richer insights.60% of the sample is currently invested while 40% is not invested.
𝟮) Achieving 100 responses was the goal, but we secured 72 due to limited time.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀:
Behavioral insights drive financial decisions—investors’ psychology is as important as strategy.
